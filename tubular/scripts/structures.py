    the "prune" command.

    This script provides logic to clean up old, unused course content data for
    the DraftVersioningModuleStore modulestore, more commonly referred to as the
    "Split Mongo" or "Split" modulestore (DraftVersioningModuleStore subclasses
    SplitMongoModuleStore). All courses and assets that have newer style locator
    keys use DraftVersioningModuleStore. These keys start with "course-v1:",
    "ccx-v1:", or "block-v1:". Studio authored content data for this modulestore
    is saved as immutable data structures. The edx-platform code never cleans up
    old data however, meaning there is an unbounded history of a course's
    content revisions stored in MongoDB.

    The older modulestore is DraftModuleStore, sometimes called "Old Mongo".
    This code does not address that modulestore in any way. That modulestore
    handles courses that use the old "/" separator, such as
    "MITx/6.002x/2012_Spring", as well as assets starting with "i4x://".

    Create a Change Plan JSON file describing the operations needed to prune the

    The Change Plan JSON is a dictionary with two keys:

    "delete" - A sorted array of Structure document IDs to delete. Since MongoDB
    object IDs are created in ascending order by timestamp, this means that the
    oldest documents come earlier in the list.

    "update_parents" - A list of [Structure ID, New Parent/Previous ID] pairs.
    This is used to re-link the oldest preserved Intermediate Structure back to
    the Original Structure, so that we don't leave the database in a state where
    a Structure's "previous_version" points to a deleted Structure.

    Specifying a --details file will generate a more verbose, human-readable
    text description of the Change Plan for verification purposes. The details
    file will only display Structures that are reachable from an Active Version,
    so any Structures that are "orphaned" as a result of partial runs of this
    script or Studio race conditions will not be reflected. That being said,
    orphaned Structures are detected and properly noted in the Change Plan JSON.
