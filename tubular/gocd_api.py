        Given:

            - a datetime representing the current time (typically the production release time)
        find the advancement pipeline that should be advanced/deployed to production.

        The algorithm:
        - Query the value stream map containing the upstream pipeline materials of the advancement pipeline.
        - Find the initial upstream pipeline material.
        - Check the time at which the first job of the first stage was triggered.
        - If the job was triggered before the last release time relative to the passed-in time, found.
        - If not, keep going backwards into pipeline history until found.

        Params:
            advance_pipeline_name (str): Pipeline name which contains the manual stage to advance.
            advance_stage_name (str): Stage name in pipeline which requires manual advancement.
            relative_to (datetime): Datetime relative to which the release should occur.
                If None, use the current datetime.
